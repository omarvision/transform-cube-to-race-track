# transform-cube-to-race-track
In this tutorial I use blender to make a racetrack for a game. I transform a cube into a racetrack. I use the extrude method over and over again to get a track shape and then connect the faces to loop it shut. I then add a couple of subdivision surface modifiers for smoothness.  I don't stop at blender. We take the track into Unity and have a car drive around the track with a camera follow.
